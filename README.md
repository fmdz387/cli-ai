## Installation

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmdz387/cli-ai/refs/heads/master/setup.sh | bash -s <your_anthropic_api_key>
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the CLI AI Assistant by typing `s` followed by your natural language command. Here are some examples:

1. Basic usage:
   ```
   s list all files in the current directory
   ```
   This will translate to: `ls -la`

2. Complex commands:
   ```
   s find all python files modified in the last 7 days
   ```
   This might translate to: `find . -name "*.py" -mtime -7`

3. System information:
   ```
   s show system memory usage
   ```
   This could translate to: `free -h`

4. Package management:
   ```
   s update all installed packages
   ```
   On Ubuntu/Debian, this might translate to: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`


## Edge Cases and Notes:

- If the AI doesn't understand your request, it will try to provide the closest matching command or ask for clarification.
- Keep requests focused on a single task for optimal results.
- Remember that the generated commands are executed in your current shell environment. Be cautious with commands that might affect your system globally.
- By default, the assistant will regularly wait for your interaction before executing commands.
